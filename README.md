Wrote this to register for a class that I wanted to join. It was
full so I automated checking for an open spot, set to 45 min,
and eventually got in 10 days later. Woooo

I was already in the other section of the class so I also had to drop
the one I was in when the other opened. Couldn't exactly test that out,
but it worked. == risk
